*Classic* `Geth` is the command line interface for running a full Ethereum based node in Go.

By installing and running a full Ethererum Classic node.

# Prerequisites

*Double check project websites for latest installation instructions*

#### Homebrew

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) - package manager for macOS

```
$ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```
Simply follow through installation in terminal.

Check installation in terminal.

```
$ brew -v
Homebrew 1.7.1
Homebrew/homebrew-core (git revision b87a; last commit 2018-07-25)
```

#### Go lang. and a C compilar (xcode)

Easily install Go Programming Language by downloading a binary distribution at the [Go Lang.](https://golang.org/) website.

Check installation in terminal.

```
$ go version
go version go1.10.3 darwin/amd64
```

Install xcode.

```
$ xcode-select --install
```

# Install

Install Classic Geth using Homebrew
```
$ brew install ethereumproject/classic/geth
```
Example of the output:
```
$ brew install ethereumproject/classic/geth

```

Check installation in terminal.

```
$ geth version
Geth
Version: v5.5.0-382aa8f
Protocol Versions: [63 62]
Network Id: 1
Go Version: go1.9.3
Go OS: darwin
Go Arch: amd64
Machine ID: fbe5f99f

GOROOT=/usr/local/Cellar/go/1.9.3/libexec
```

Update Geth if applicable.

Classic Geth is maintained by the Ethereum Classic developer community. You can upgrade geth version by running `brew upgrade geth` in terminal.

# Initialize

Initialize Classic Geth by running `geth` however consider reading on before running geth.

```
$ geth
```

`--fast` Increase performance to sync at the cost of downloading only block state data.

`--cache=VALUE` Further increase performance by adjusting memory (megabytes) allowance of the database. Default is 1024 MB.

```
$ geth --fast --cache=1024
```

Running Classic Geth downloads and syncs the entire Ethereum Classic blockchain. Geth returns the sync status. E.g.:

```
2018-07-25 22:51:36 Sync       #151305 of  #6031258 36529b08   638/ 517/12 blk/txs/mgas sec  8/25 peers
```

This example shows the local node has downloaded and synced blocks `#151305 of  #6031258`. Simply allow the node to sync. This process can take hours. When the local node has reach the current block height, it will continue to import new blocks.

Closing geth will stop the local node and starting the node will continue to sync where it left off.

# Commands & Flags

While geth is running, open a new terminal and view list of commands and flags.

`$ geth -h`, `$ geth help`, `$ geth -help`
